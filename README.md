# nlp1
Project for UvA course NLP-1 year 2017-2018

__Remark__: the directory experiments misses the files _model.pt_ (too large) and _sec02-21.gold.tagged_ (licensed). The files can be downloaded from blackboard.

## Planning
* week 46
  * Start Repo (MdJ)
  * Generate sentences (MdJ)
  * Document Outline (MdJ)
  * ...
* week 47
  * generate 100 sentences from a template
  * (manually) construct other sentences to test long distance/multiple distractors
  * 2a (JM)
  * 2b (DR)
  * 2c (DR)
  * 2d (JM)
  * (BONUS: 2f is cool but difficult, probably we should not to it)
  * manual analysis of the errors: what is our model could at, what not?
  * (BONUS: use real world sentences from Penn Tree Bank that are not used for training, doable)
  
  
  
* Tasks that can be picked up
  * Write Background section 
  * Write Related Work section, summary Linzen paper (MJ)  
  * Notes about the research idea we came up with
